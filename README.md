Project: estimate chronical disease multistate model with a progressive state, using cross-sectional data.
Countries like Argentina doesn´t have longitudinal or panel surveys to cath transition rates between states. This is important in health tranistion theory, because mortality indexes are not enough to explain changes in population health becausethe mortality gains are decreasing. Also, chronical diseases, which are the most prevalent, have progressive states to death. Get knowledge of that form by age can allowd to think specific health policies.
This is a continuation of my Master´s thesis. Here I expect to add more solid methodology for the two-state case, and develop some way to estimate the progressive case.
